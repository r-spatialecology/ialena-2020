# Intro to rspatial

- I would show how to read raster data, understand its structure, visualize it using *tmap*, and provide some links to more resources. In details:

- Intro (lecture)

- Making maps in R (lecture)
- Making maps in R (practical)

- Reading raster data, understanding its structure, and doing simple preprocessing (crop and mask?) (lecture)
