- Summary of the first part (lecture)

### Break (30 minutes)
We could ask for questions during the intro, and then during the break, we could look at them and prepare our answers.

### Part II (MHKH, 90 minutes)
Introduce *landscapemetrics* and show basic and advanced usage with some focus on integration into workflows.

- Intro (lecture)

- Simple calculation of single and multiple metrics (lecture)
- Simple calculation of single and multiple metrics (practical)

- Plotting and sampling functions (lecture)
- Plotting and sampling functions (practical)

- Summary (lecture)

### Part III (JN, MHKH)
Q and A for both parts
